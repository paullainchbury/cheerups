u.facebook_details.fql_query("SELECT uid, name, pic_square FROM user WHERE uid = me() OR uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me())")

u.facebook_details.fql_query("SELECT message, status_id, uid FROM status WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me()) ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 50")

this is the query for friend's statuses:

thestatuses = u.facebook_details.api("/me?fields=id,name,friends.fields(statuses.fields(from,message,updated_time))")
